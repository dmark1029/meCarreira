Every player, no matter how famous has to go through Stage 1 to reach Stage 2. Stage one is called “Subscription” and stage 2 is named “PRO”. Becoming Pro therefore means on meCarreira that the player moves from Stage 1 to Stage 2.",
  "the way to move from": "The way to move from Stage 1 to Stage 2 (becoming PRO) is by having enough market value and enough supporters. The exact requirements to become Pro are set by meCarreira but are publicly visible in the factsheet (available on website). They can vary over time, depending on the activity.",
  "players that never reach": "Players that never reach enough momentum to become PRO on meCarreira will stay in Stage 1 (Subscription) indefinite but as trading will never be deactivated and share can always be bought and sold, the player might reach the criteria to become pro at a later stage.",
  "once a player reaches": "Once a player reaches PRO (Stage 2), features such as NFT, Auctions, Draws, Votes and Staking are enabled. PRO Players are traded on public exchanges and the liquidity is moved to public exchanges (like UNISWAP).",
  "to buy Player-Coins you": "To buy Player-Share you can chose between Credit-Card and Cryptocurrency (Polygon). The easiest and fastest way is to load up your wallet with Polygon (Matic) cryptocurrency and then buy directly Player-Share. You can buy MATIC (Polygon) on almost any major cryptocurrency exchange and then send it to your wallet you have on meCarreira.com. You can also use the “Get MATIC” button In your wallet and buy Polygon (Matic) with your Credit-Card and receive them directly into your wallet. All Player-Share can be bought with Polygon (MATIC).",
  "alternatively, you can use": "Alternatively, you can use credit-card to buy Players share directly. If you chose to pay with Credit- Card, we link you with our Credit-Card Provider Wert.io that is a licensed and regulated entity in the EU. They will process your card safely and convert your Money from your card automatically into Polygon (MATIC) and then buy Member Share with that and send it to your wallet. You do not have to do anything but to chose the amount of player-share you want to buy and all the rest happens in the background.",
  "whenever you sell Player-Coins": "Whenever you sell Player-Share, you get Polygon (Matic) back to your wallet. In order to cash out Polygon as well, you can sell them on any exchange or convert them into USDT for example on Uniswap exchange . You can cash out easily back to your bank account with regulated exchanges such as Kraken.",
  "drafting is available": "Drafting is available for Players in Stage 1 (Subscription) and Stage 2 (PRO). Every player can draft up to 5 other players at any given time. This means a Player can draft more than 5 players over time but can never have more than 5 active drafts.",
  "when a player drafts": "When a player drafts another player, it is publicly visible and it has benefits for Drafter (the one who initiated it) and the draftee (the one who got drafted). The Drafter will get paid cash if the player he/she drafted will become PRO (Stage 2). It is a kickback fee for supporting him/her to success. The draftee benefits before then every time someone buys share from the drafter, the system automatically takes a percentage (usually 2%) and buys share of the draftee.",

  "players getting drafted": "Players getting drafted by high profile players will almost definitely have the best chances to reach PRO themselves.",
  "voting works that way that": "Voting works that way that the Player launches a vote where he/she places a specific question with couple answers as options. Then share holders can reply and the more share you have, the more voting power you got. If you own 10% of all share, your answer is much more powerful than someone with 0.5% of share only. Votes are on the blockchain and cannot be faked or manipulated. All you have to do is to select an answer and click on “vote”.",
  "NFTs are digital artworks": "NFTs are digital artworks issued on the blockchain. Every NFT gets his own share that represents the ownership of that NFT. NFTs can be sent around or sold again on third party platform such as OpenSea or Rarible. The owner of the NFT is the owner of the artwork and the claim(see below) and owns all the rights to it.",
  "on meCarreira players": "On meCarreira players are the issuers of NFTs. They ultimately decide which NFTs are launched and how they are launched(Auction, Raffle, Charity, etc.).",
  "auctions are done for NFTs": "Auctions are done for NFTs where the player selects a certain NFT and decides to auction it off. The only way to participate in the auction is by owning Member Share and stake them. Every auction has an end date and once passed, the highest bidder gets the NFT including all “claiming rights” to it and is free to do with the NFT what he/she wants. Only the share of the highest bidder are locked and once the auction is won, taken and moved into the liquidity pool and therefore given back to the community. If you are the highest bidder, keep in mind that your share are locked until the auction is finished.",
  "raffles or sometimes referred": "Raffles or sometimes referred to as Draws are a type of lottery where the player selects an NFT and lets everybody participate in the raffle until a certain deadline has been reached. Then a random selection takes place and a lucky winner is drawn and gets the NFT for free. The more share you have staked, the higher your chance is to win in the draw. Someone with 1000 share staked has 10 times more chance to win than someone with 100. Once you won the NFT, you are free to send or sell it as you please. In order to participate you must stake and then actively participate by clicking the participation button. This is to prevent inactive owners from winning anything.",
  "some NFTs can have a claim": "Some NFTs can have a claim. A claim is basically a right to redeem something. Real World Items such as match worn boots, jerseys or other items but also experiences can be placed into a claim and the NFT represents this claim, making the owner of the NFT the owner of the claim. This allows the owner to sell it digitally without having to send them around. Claims can be redeemed through meCarreira where meCarreira AG acts as bridge between the player(issuer) and NFT holder(redeemer) but meCarreira has no impact on what players place into their NFTs as they are the issuers.",
  "player-Coins can only be": "Player-Share can only be sent once a player reaches PRO status. At any time, they can be bought and sold but not sent. The reason the sending is limited is that we want to prevent secondary markets to show up before the player has been through its subscription phase. The share are never locked and they are in your wallet at any time.",

  "what_is_mecarreira1": "meCarreira is an innovative platform that combines blockchain technology with the world of football, allowing fans to become stakeholders, fans, and investors in rising football talents. Users can trade football players similarly to stocks, buying into uprising talents and potentially profiting as they succeed.",
  "what_is_mecarreira2": "By investing, users validate their predictions about players, and the amount of their investment catches the interest of other fans. They can also gain exclusive access to players and special football experiences and items based on the number of shares they hold, reflecting their loyalty.",
  "what_is_mecarreira3": "meCarreira distinguishes between Player Fan Clubs (PFC), where users can buy and trade shares, and Official Player Fan Clubs, which offer on top of trading, exclusive rewards and privileges directly from the player. Each time a player share is bought or sold a small transaction fee goes into a pool, stored on the blockchain, which the player can withdraw when claiming his or her own PFC making it his/her Official PFC. In that regard, a player can monetize his/her personality, by giving back to the most loyal fans in a very fair way, without being associated with greed. The more a community invests in a PFC, the higher the likelihood of the player claiming it as their Official PFC (or OPFC). As the community grows, users' initial investments appreciate in value, providing potential financial upsides. Whether choosing to hold onto shares (like shares in stocks) for long-term benefits or cashing out, meCarreira aims to democratize football success, ensuring that even small investors have the opportunity for significant gains.",
  "meCarreira is uniquely positioned": "meCarreira is uniquely positioned as a blockchain-based platform that offers both football fans and aspiring investors the opportunity to trade football players like stocks. Our platform sets itself apart by providing a fair and transparent way to invest in football talent without being associated with greed. The money invested can be withdrawn at any time, ensuring financial flexibility and peace of mind for our users. Additionally, meCarreira offers exclusive access to football players, allowing fans to engage with their favorite athletes on a personal level.",
  "You are able to get": "You are able to get direct access to players and invest in them (they do not get your money). The only thing between you and the player is the blockchain. On meCarreira, being early and committed can be very rewarding which makes it unique to all other social and community platforms.",
  "A PFC serves as a virtual": "A PFC serves as a virtual representation of a specific football player, allowing you to invest by buying and trading its shares (like shares in stocks). Meanwhile, the Official PFC (or OPFC) is the claimed representation by the actual footballers, allowing users to buy, trade, and access personal items issued by the players.",
  "When you buy tokens of": "When you buy shares of Player A with 100 MATIC, the ensuing transaction will reflect a higher price per share due to the prior purchase. Hence, the next person purchasing with 100 MATIC will receive fewer player shares than you did. Conversely, if you decide to sell those shares later, you would likely receive more than 100 MATIC in return due to the increased price per share. This mechanism continues to operate with each buy and sell transaction, dynamically adjusting the share price based on market activity. Similarly, if someone sells shares after your purchase, the price per share would decrease, affecting the amount of MATIC received from subsequent transactions.",
