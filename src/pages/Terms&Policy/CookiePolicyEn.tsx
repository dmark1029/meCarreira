                  The csrftoken cookie is an essential component of Django's
                  security measures against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
                  attacks. When a user accesses a web page, the corresponding
                  view generates a unique CSRF token for that user's session.
                  When the user submits the form or makes the request, the
                  server checks whether the received CSRF token matches the
                  expected value for that session and action. This verification
                  prevents unauthorized actions and ensures that the request
                  originated from the intended source.

                <td>
                  The sessionid cookie is crucial for managing user sessions
                  within Django web applications. Sessions enable the server to
                  maintain state and user-specific data across multiple requests
                  from the same user. When a user accesses a Django application,
                  the server generates a unique session ID and associates it
                  with the user's session data. This session ID is stored in the
                  sessionid cookie. As the user interacts with the application,
                  the session ID is used to track and retrieve their session
                  data on the server. This enables the server to maintain
                  personalized data and settings for the user throughout their
                  visit to the application.

                  The device_id plays a critical role in Mecarreira's security
                  strategy. Upon a user's login to our platform, a unique
                  device_id is generated and subsequently stored as a cookie.
                  This specific cookie undergoes validation during each
                  authenticated user request. This stringent validation process
                  occurs independently of the user's access token, even if it
                  were to be compromised. This approach serves as an additional
                  layer of protection, thwarting unauthorized actions and
                  maintaining security standards across the board.
