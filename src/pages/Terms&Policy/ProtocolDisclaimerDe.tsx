              meCarreira is a decentralized protocol that people can use to
              trade ERC-20 tokens and NFTs, submit votes, win NFT and bid for
              NFTs. The meCarreira protocol is a set of smart contracts that are
              deployed on the public Polygon Blockchain and can be used by
              anyone without the need to use any other products developed and
              run by the meCarreira AG, including the website
              https://meCarreira.com. You can access the meCarreira protocol
              through other web or mobile interfaces. You are responsible for
              doing your own diligence on those interfaces to understand the
              fees and risks they present. The use of the meCarreira protocol
              involves various risks, including, but not limited to, losses
              while digital assets are being supplied to the meCarreira protocol
              and losses due to the fluctuation of prices of shares including
              NFTs.
